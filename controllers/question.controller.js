/**
 * TODO: REVISIT THIS
 * QUESTION CONTROLLER
 *
 * Here we define all the CRUD operations operations in the
 * callback functions that will be called when the route
 * end-points are hit by a request.
 *
 * These functions are stored in variables and exported to
 * be used in the routes directory (we have put them together
 * in one index.js file for simplicity and maintanability of code)
 *
 * These methods defined here as controllers ultimately call
 * the various mongoose methods for constructing and querying
 * the data in the MongoDB database through the documents which
 * are instances of models.
 *
 * Design & Architecture of the Database:
 *
 * The database is designed such that there is one collection
 * that will store User documents that contain all the user
 * information as well as the array of todos items.
 *
 * Quering the database is therefore done through finding
 * documents that relate to the authenticated user and only
 * returning that single document, or where the client has
 * made a request to edit or update that document.
 *
 * Using Bcrypt to hash passwords saved in the Database:
 *
 * We make use of the bcrypt library whic is a popular password
 * hashing library to hash the passwords before we store them
 * in the database. This is a key security feature since it
 * ensures that the user data is safe and sound even in the
 * unfortunate event of the database being hacked.
 *
 * When the user signs in, the bcrypt.compare() method is
 * used to compare the password entered by the user in the
 * frontend and hashed password in the database. Only after
 * the user this process is successful that the authToken
 * is generated and the user is allowed to sign in the
 * application
 *
 * UTILS
 *
 * The utils necessary for the application and being used in
 * the route methods are defined at the top of this file under
 * the 'UTILS' title below. The createNewID() method and the
 * createUserAuthToken() are defined to be used in the methods
 * that follow below
 *
